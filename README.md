# Coffee and Studying Time Analysis â˜•ðŸ“Š  

This project is a statistical study analysing the effect of coffee consumption on students' study time.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Content  
âœ… **Hypothesis:** Students who drink coffee study longer than students who do not drink coffee.  
âœ… **Data:** Study times of 30 randomly selected 30 coffee drinkers and 30 non-coffee drinkers  
âœ… **Statistical Test:** Independent two sample t-test (t-test)  
âœ… **Results:** The average study duration of students who drink coffee is significantly higher.

2. Run `coffee_analysis.R` file  
3. Install `ggplot2` and `tidyverse` libraries to visualise the results

## ðŸ“Š Result  
According to the results of independent two sample t-test:  
- Average working time of coffee drinkers: **5.5 hours**  
- Average working time of non-coffee drinkers: **4.8 hours**  
- p-value: **0.006** (**p < 0.05 for a significant difference!**)  

ðŸ“¢ **Conclusion:** Drinking coffee can indeed be associated with longer working time! ðŸš€
